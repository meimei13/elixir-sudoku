# â¬› Sudoku â¬œ

This is a small Sudoku solver and board generator written in Elixir.
Since this is a functional exercise, I tried to avoid using anything
imperative or with state! As such, this solver is composed of lots
of small functions ping ponging between each other ðŸ¤”. The program is composed of three modules:

1. **Board**: Provides a set of functions for representing and manipulating a board, such
as asking if a cell is empty or grabbing a row
2. **Sudoku**: Using the functions which represent the board, this module uses a back-tracking
algorithm to recursively fill empty cells with the least number of possibilities until
the entire board is solved
3. **Generator**: The generator will fill an empty board of m x n dimensions, shuffle
the elements, and then continue removing cells until there is more than one solution (it 
returns the board with only one solution before that point)

## Usage

The program doesn't take input from I/O or output anything to stdout. You can try the functions
as in the following example, which generates and solves a 3x3 board 
from the elixir interactive shell:

```
iex -S mix
iex(1)> Sudoku.solve(Generator.gen({3, 3}), {3, 3})
[
  [4, 6, 3, 1, 5, 9, 2, 7, 8],
  [9, 5, 7, 2, 8, 6, 3, 4, 1],
  [1, 2, 8, 4, 3, 7, 9, 5, 6],
  [7, 4, 2, 5, 1, 8, 6, 9, 3],
  [6, 1, 5, 9, 4, 3, 8, 2, 7],
  [3, 8, 9, 7, 6, 2, 5, 1, 4],
  [5, 3, 4, 8, 9, 1, 7, 6, 2],
  [2, 9, 6, 3, 7, 4, 1, 8, 5],
  [8, 7, 1, 6, 2, 5, 4, 3, 9]
]
```

## Installation

Add to an existing project:

```elixir
def deps do
  [
    {:sudoku, "~> 0.1.0"}
  ]
end
```

More likely, you'll probably just want to grab the repo and run the tests.

To run tests, while in the top level directory, run: ``mix test``
